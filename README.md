# TCHRs-Assistant-Bot
**Quick Overview:**

**Project Title:**

TCHR's Assistant


**Description:**

Discord bot designed specifically for TCHR, a competitive team on the typing platform Nitrotype.com. 
https://www.nitrotype.com/team/TCHR

Displays stats and user info for team members, calculate stats for team-related events. Stats are connected and updated via a Google spreadsheet and lib.so website (maintained by team management).

Created and developed entirely by @michymichelle, https://www.nitrotype.com/racer/michymichelle, back when I was on the team as co-captain, officer, and team manager.


**Motivation:**

In the summer of 2020, I became actively involved with a small community on the typing game platform called Nitrotype, a competitive typing test game. Many of its users have Discord. In the game, you can join teams and compete  with others on a leaderboard. Each team is ranked based on how many activity points each team gains in the last 7 days. I am currently on a team called TCHR, and I've gotten pretty involved with team management.
I wanted to develop a Discord bot using Python that will be able to connect to a spreadsheet I've created for displaying user activity and other statistics.
Our team has a pay schedule where we pay our members in-game currency every week dependent on their activity. We originally calculated this in a rather manual manner, but the bot will now be able to calculate the correct amount with a single command. This command will also be available to regular players, which can encourage higher team activity.


**Platforms involved:**

Discord, Google Spreadsheets, Nitrotype.com


**Installation:**

The bot has yet to be officially published on Discord, so in the meantime, the bot can be accessed by manually inviting it to a Discord server. The bot is currently active on the TCHR server. To invite the bot to your server, head to https://discordapi.com/permissions.html#0 and paste this for the client ID: 844223653167497237. To gain complete control over the bot, install all attached files, and invite the bot to the server. Most of the information presented by the bot can also be viewed at tinyurl.com/TCHRteam. Be sure to grant all server administration permissions to the bot for full control.


**How to Use:**

This bot was developed specifically for the TCHR team. The command prefix for the bot is a period: .
All of the commands are listed via a help command. Once the bot has been invited to a server, type _.tchrhelp_ in any channel. The bot will return a helpful list of all commands and a brief description of how to use each one.
For example, _.tchrhelp_
